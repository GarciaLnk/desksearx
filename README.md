<br />

DeskSearx is a desktop search tool powered by Apache Lucene and Apache Tika for efficient file searching on your personal computer.

This program is a work in progress, indexing is done in a single-threaded manner and the user interface might be unresponsive during the process. The selected directory paths are not indexed recursively, only the files in the root directory are indexed. DeskSearx will try to index every file it finds, no matter the file type or size.

## Features

- Index and search the content of text documents, PDFs, emails, and more.
- Real-time file system monitoring for index updates.
- Multilingual search support with language-specific analyzers (only English and Spanish are supported at the moment).
- Sleek user interface with MaterialFX styling.
